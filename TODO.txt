Let’s implement a map specific drop and a map exclusive drop zoneDrop with a guranteedDrop in this zone for quest. That means the map exclusive drop is not in the monster’s base table. 
Every zone gets assigned a loot tier. Loot Tier determines:
• Drop rarity weights
• Verdant Shard chance
• Rune material availability
• Crafting material quality

Each zone applies multipliers to the monster’s base drop table from common to epic. Zones can add their own drops on top of monster drops: extraDrop. Zone loot weight formula

FinalDropChance = BaseChance x ZoneMultiplier x LevelModifier
